//This file is to hold all of the random functions used that we are not going to create Objects for.

//Hex To RGB Function
function hexToRgb(hex){
    var result = /^#?([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})$/i.exec(hex);
    return result ? {
        r: parseInt(result[1], 16),
        g: parseInt(result[2], 16),
        b: parseInt(result[3], 16)
    }: null;
};

//Function for inheritence 
function inheritPrototype(childObject, parentObject) {
    // As discussed above, we use the Crockford’s method to copy the properties and methods from the parentObject onto the childObject
    // So the copyOfParent object now has everything the parentObject has 
    var copyOfParent = Object.create(parentObject.prototype);

    //Then we set the constructor of this new object to point to the childObject.
    // Why do we manually set the copyOfParent constructor here, see the explanation immediately following this code block.
    copyOfParent.constructor = childObject;

    // Then we set the childObject prototype to copyOfParent, so that the childObject can in turn inherit everything from copyOfParent (from parentObject)
    childObject.prototype = copyOfParent;
}
